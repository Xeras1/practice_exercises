In this git directory you can see the projects I struggled the most and had the best result during my BootCamp at IronHack.

Eventough some of them are not finished, I would like to say that I started the course without not a single idea of what programing is, that's why I fell so proud of them. 

Hereunder I write few descriptions of the projects:

    - chess.rb: Was my first week project. Mathematical logic is what I employed in order to reach the result. 

    - movie_lover: This was different, employing imdb gem was kind of tricky and I went step by step, though the last ones are not made, they have the same logic as the code written before.
    
    - vikings.js: this fighting pits was funny. We started using js, leaving behind ruby language for a week. Doing these exercise settled lot of ideas and js language. Very order code (from my point of view)


    - spotify_searcher: In this case, the search was done with the appi from spoty, I struggled a lot with the js. This is, again, not finished; however, completing the first step, the following ones where very similar. 

    
    - spotify_skeleton_master: This exercisa was key for my final project, which has lot of js. 

    - places_ive_been_master: This exercise allow me to understand the basis of cookies and how to work with the navegator information

    - rotator: It took much longer than what I would have like; After lot of changes and variances, I made a js from scratch, unique and usefull to a single porpuse (go to www.kpiqua.com). Lot of people told me to use a photo library, I prefered creating out of nothing... at least that is the core of coding, isn't?


Hope you enjoy the code
